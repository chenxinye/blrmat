    # 1. Check out the code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # 2. Install CUDA Toolkit (using a community action)
    - name: Install CUDA Toolkit

    # 3. Configure CMake
    - name: Configure CMake
      run: cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

    # 4. Build the project
    # This verifies that syntax, linking, and headers are correct.
    - name: Build
      run: cmake --build build --verbose

    # 5. (Optional) Run Test
    # NOTE: This step is commented out because GitHub Actions runners 
    # usually DO NOT have GPUs. Uncomment this only if using a Self-Hosted GPU Runner.
